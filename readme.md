Project Description: Developed a program that generates public and private keys, encrypts and decrypts messages, and creates and verifies digital signatures using the RSA algorithm in Python.

Key features:
❖ Public and private key generation: The program generates a pair of keys, consisting of a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption, using the RSA algorithm.
❖ Encryption: The program uses the partner's public key to encrypt a message (plaintext) into ciphertext, which can only be decrypted using the private key.
❖ Decryption: The program decrypts the ciphertext using the user's private key to obtain the original plaintext message.
❖ Digital signature: The program creates a digital signature of the user's name using their private key, which can be verified using the partner's public key.
❖ Signature verification: The program verifies the partner's digital signature using their public key.
